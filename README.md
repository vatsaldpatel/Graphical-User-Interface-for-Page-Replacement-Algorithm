# Visualization_Of_OS_Algorithms
Part of OS Project(Associated with PDPU)

This project was implemented as a part of Operating System course at PDPU. For the project, I developed logic for various Page replacement algorithms with Belady's Anomaly like FIFO, LIFO, Optimal Page Replacement, Second Chance and Random Page. I also provided graphs using matplotlib for better interpretation of the project. Further I built a GUI for the project using Python Tkinter.
